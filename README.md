# IT Access and Unemployment in The COVID-19 Pandemic 

This repository is to track the changes in R and STATA scripts which are related to the project. 

## Abstract

One highly predicted change in working conditions post-COVID-19 is the increased prevalence of digital transformation aimed at facilitating working from home (WFH). These digital transformations, however, can be resource-intensive for less-ready businesses, and resource access frictions can slow down the expected transformation towards WFH. The presence and extent of these frictions in the current corporate landscape in the U.S. are not yet known empirically. Particularly, it is not clear how much access to IT resources is needed to make these massive transitions possible. 

Capitalizing on the opportunity provided by the introduction of stay-at-home orders across 48 states in the U.S. during the first wave of COVID-19 and natural variations in availability of IT services and resources in different regional (county-level) areas, we examine if the lack of sufficient access to businesses to IT resources posed as a barrier in the seamless transformation to WFH during those stay-at-home periods.
